<p>We're a comedy troupe in Toronto. </p>
    <p>
An Elephant Empire show features an original story told in three parts. Expect strange, dramatic, and with heart. We get <i>tense</i> with comic relief. The rest of the show is sprinkled with fast and silly sketch comedy.        
    </p>
    <p>
    Here's an entire half hour Elephant Empire show in a ninety second teaser.
